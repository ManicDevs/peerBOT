- SCTP datagram and sequenced packets implementations, just stream for now.

- UDP implementation, incomplete.

- Implement some kind of network events such as libutp does, so libutp can
  be added and a more robust implementation for already implemented protocols,
  it may also be easier to switch protocols or use multiples at once from
  high-level calls.

- Implement UDT

- IPv6.
